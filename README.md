### Comment

#### So we are going to use the tools mentioned and make one of them work for us

##### We are going to use the official API for instagram and twitter in the first try

##### We are going to use the selenium for instagram and twitter in the second try

##### We are going to use the scraper libraries for instagram and twitter in the third try

## About Developing our own tool

### We can integrate the code developed with user-interface and then automate process with selenium or cronjobs or celery depending on the stack we are using

## Requirements

1. Python 3.6+
The other requirements will be added here and to the requirements.txt <!-- markdownlint-enable-file MD000 -->

## Risk/Challenges

### We might run into ban from instagram and twitter if we are not careful with the automation

## TODO

How to run ->  locally
